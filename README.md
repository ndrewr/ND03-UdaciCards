# Udacicards

A project built in fulfillment of Udacity's React Developer nanodegree program.
UdaciCards allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes using those decks. A basic notification system can remind the User to practice every afternoon.

Uses React Native in combo with Expo and Redux.

Bootstrapped with [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
