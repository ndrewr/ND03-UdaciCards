# Udacicards

A project built in fulfillment of Udacity's React Developer nanodegree program.
UdaciCards allows users to study collections of flashcards. The app will allow users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

Uses React Native in combo with Redux.

Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Based on [this project template](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter).
